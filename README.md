 ### About me
 My name is Aman Singh. I am a self-motivated individual with a dynamic personality who has quick learning ability and passion for creating new things. I always love to explore new technologies. Sharing knowledge is my best part. I feel that unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow. And by sharing the knowledge I always get a chance to get into the depth of the topics what others want to learn from me.

### Boy Scout Rule

I love open source.  I am not a heavy maintainer of any large libraries, but I really like the boyscout rule.  I contribute to things as I come across issues that I think other people might struggle with.  This may be things that are overlooked by someone who is deep into the library.  I ðŸ’• a good onboarding readme with good example.
